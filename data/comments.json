That being said I used to have an issue showing up to work at time or at all and my boss told me \"Cody, when you're here, you're amazing, but you're never here!\" It feels like only on a harvest moon the third Tuesday of winter solstice is when you can exchange a few emails from one of the (again world class, outstanding) team members and the stars have aligned and things are as they should be. But until then, their chatbot leaves much to be desired. Clearly I have too much time on my hands haha, I'm wanting to refer them to everyone and their mother and so far I have 5 referrals, 2 that have deposited successfully and 3 that haven't. I've gotten referral credit for one thus far and its my understanding they were still in the process of rolling out the program ( as generous as the sign up bonus itself there are only winners here!) I have faith that it'll work out, and actually Im changing to 5 stars in good faith because idk whats going on behind the scenes but every interaction has been great so thank you thank you.",

Their ability to forecast market trends and provide strategic recommendations has been invaluable in maximizing my investment returns.\n\nMoreover, their customer service is top-notch. Every interaction with their team, whether through their 24/7 support line or direct consultations, has been professional, courteous, and incredibly helpful. It’s clear they prioritize building long-term relationships with their clients, making you feel like a partner rather than just another account.\n\nAnytime Capital also impresses with their technological edge. Their platform is user-friendly, offering easy access to manage my portfolio, view detailed analytics, and execute trades quickly and securely. The peace of mind that comes from knowing your investments are in safe hands cannot be overstated.\n\nIn terms of fees, Anytime Capital is very transparent and competitive.

So I was drilled and had to send my ID, social security card, and a PGE bill to show proof of address after the fact. Then a couple days ago the person that had all my information was able to transfer my paycheck that was deposited to my card to their account and now they have started an investigation, but unfortunately I'm the victim, I'm wondering why didn't they interrogate the person that committed the crime just like I was interrogated to try and get my money back the first time. If you requested all that information for proof of residency, they why didn't you do the same to the person on the other end of the phone. Its very unprofessional and nobody suffers but Tracy P.

You extend a helping hand and then you do not follow through. I have now lost all confidence in Netspend and feel like you do not care about helping your clients. I have called mutilple times and left numerous messages and it is completely silent on your end. I am going to to assume now that Netspend only cares about taking your money and pretending to want to help. What was the point of reaching out if you were not going to follow through. I want a call back immediately or and email response asap. this is literally the worst customer service and a i was hoping it was only from the call center but it is obvious this lack of concern goes all the way to the top of corporate and it is sad.

This is embarrassing for your company and people need to know. If i do not get a response soon i will be forced to reach out to the BBB, my district attorney, my personal lawyer and the local news to report on how your company did not close a card reported stolen and over $900 in charge being taken from my account. and then how a corporate higher up reached out only because of a review I had and then offered to help and then basically ghosted me.

        "comment": "Good mornin. I'm experiencing Netspend trouble again folks. I called yesterday noon and the customer representative was trying to tell me to activate my 10th Netspend Card they've sent. I admittedly had responded to a NO! Because many times I've been charge for every card I received and every month ive paid. I'm on I pay monthly outta of my SSI check every month. So that had been including $5.00 a month plus the activation card as well. U know none of the representatives has ever told that I didn't have to activate every time a card was being sent almost every month. I was fed up to here with them dang cards that I was being charge and token advantage by the customer rep. I've only lost one card that I got replace and yes paid for the activation charge then a coupl3 of months later someone stoled my card outta of my wallet at the grocery store. Yes I report it stolen and stop it. So yes they sent me another card that I had to pay for activation fee. Okay 2 cards were fine to pay, after a month every time I would speak to a Netspend Customer representative they would send me another card sometimes 3 times in a month. I was a dummy activating evey card I received one card would do for all the other cards was getting in the mail because it seem like every representative I would talk to they would send a darn card.I got fed up one day and ask nicely why am I receiving all these cards and all these charges I can't prove because it's in my other Galaxy phone thats broke.i can get printed copies of how many times I payed for these cards but at the same time I switch with all netspend access\nthinking it was going to be better but my SSI PAYMENTS ARE LATE. WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation. I feel from my rare disease or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangual\n\n\n\n\n\nIn damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL. IM STILL TRYING TO MANAGE ON TEXTING with no fingers on the phone.NETSPEND CORPTIAON I DONT GET NO GOV ASSITANCR OR EVEN IF I DIS THATS NONE OF NEtSPEND CORPTION CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. WITH THISAPPRECIATE IF SOMEONE,TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS AND GET MY C$$ARD situated with one car one monthly pameny every 25th nd a littl respect on me being disabled ampute on legs and fingers get and give the thw benefit and the doubt to read snd recivied government SSI check on same card on every 25th of the month and stop over charging my card and stop ovwr sendi h me cards nomore. Also i dont why they dont overdraft my cardover more than a $100 thats the most.why??? Why send me proof of saying netdp3nd lets u overdraft over $500.00 as long as $200.00 or $500.00 is being put in The latest was the 25th days in a month.

WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation. I feel from my rare disease or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangual\n\n\n\n\n\nIn damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL. IM STILL TRYING TO MANAGE ON TEXTING with no fingers on the phone.NETSPEND CORPTIAON I DONT GET NO GOV ASSITANCR OR EVEN IF I DIS THATS NONE OF NEtSPEND CORPTION CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. WITH THISAPPRECIATE IF SOMEONE,TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS AND GET MY C$$ARD situated with one car one monthly pameny every 25th nd a littl respect on me being disabled ampute on legs and fingers get and give the thw benefit and the doubt to read snd recivied government SSI check on same card on every 25th of the month and stop over charging my card and stop ovwr sendi h me cards nomore. Also i dont why they dont overdraft my cardover more than a $100 thats the most.why??? Why send me proof of saying netdp3nd lets u overdraft over $500.00 as long as $200.00 or $500.00 is being put in The latest was the 25th days in a month. Im asking as a diabled person if they can keep my SSI CHECK on 25th every month. I know that i hope a customer rep csn understand\nDate of experience: September 25, 2023",

I must have spoken to 5 customer service representatives regarding the pin number. They sent me two letters containing two new pin #s that not one works. I havent been able to use the atm or use my debit card for 2 weeks. The only solution they suggest is changing the pin #. Which I have done two times. I drive 1 hr to MA for the nearest PNC branch and have stayed loyal. The inconvenience of branch location as well as customer service is making it really hard to remain a customer.",

        "comment": "I have been with PNC Bank for at least a decade and a half. Today’s PNC telephone customer service is horrendous. The agent Janelle, who has one of the worst personalities imaginable, kept repeating the same answer over and over even after explaining that didn’t address my question. It was a complete failure to comprehend a very straightforward question. Then she hung up on me and falsely reported in her notes that the call disconnected likely as a move to cover herself for poor customer service. Every phone agent I talked with has been horrendous in customer service. This bank has spiraled downhill so much I am the only one in my family that still has an account. Everyone has jumped ship - my mom, brother, ex-husband, daughters, friends etc. As soon as I severe all direct deposit and debit lines, I am dropping this bank as well.",

Every time we call, we’d talk to someone new and whatever the last person asked for, the new person would ask for again and then ask for something altogether new. We did that for 2 weeks feeling like we were getting the runaround until one day the title company called and was told we couldn’t talk to them any longer because it was in foreclosure. The title company checked and nothing had been filed with the district court. Over the next couple of weeks the executor (only one allowed to talk to them now) has sent reinstatement paperwork and a cashier’s check per the attorney’s instructions only to be told by someone else in the attorney’s office, “Why did you do that? It’s not in foreclosure yet.” We have yet to receive a simple payoff and closing has been delayed 4 weeks to date. We are now in danger of losing the buyer or, at best, the loan costing the buyer more because of PNC’s lack of concern, customer service and reasonable business practices. Would NEVER do business with them.",
