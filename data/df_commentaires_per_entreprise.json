That being said I used to have an issue showing up to work at time or at all and my boss told me \"Cody, when you're here, you're amazing, but you're never here!\" It feels like only on a harvest moon the third Tuesday of winter solstice is when you can exchange a few emails from one of the (again world class, outstanding) team members and the stars have aligned and things are as they should be. But until then, their chatbot leaves much to be desired. Clearly I have too much time on my hands haha, I'm wanting to refer them to everyone and their mother and so far I have 5 referrals, 2 that have deposited successfully and 3 that haven't. I've gotten referral credit for one thus far and its my understanding they were still in the process of rolling out the program ( as generous as the sign up bonus itself there are only winners here!)

Their team demonstrated an in-depth understanding of the crypto market, not just from a transactional perspective but also the regulatory and technological nuances that can make or break investment strategies in this volatile field.\n\nWhat truly sets Anytime Capital apart is their proactive approach to client relations.

The Payment HQ is the best merchant services and most trustworthy company I have dealt with. They support my industry which is considered high risk and made it very easy to get me an account approved. Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what’s best for your business. I absolutely enjoy working with The Payment HQ and of course their best rep Cesario.\nThank you Cesario & The Payment HQ for supporting my business.\n\nAdam's Ave Smoke Shop",

They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.\n\nBottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.",

I've had my netspend card for years and a hacker came along about a week ago they first changed all of my personal information, then they were able to call the company and cancel my card, and all of my security questions, Then I received a text afterwards telling me that my aceelite netspend card had been cancelled. So I was drilled and had to send my ID, social security card, and a PGE bill to show proof of address after the fact. Then a couple days ago the person that had all my information was able to transfer my paycheck that was deposited to my card to their account and now they have started an investigation, but unfortunately I'm the victim, I'm wondering why didn't they interrogate the person that committed the crime just like I was interrogated to try and get my money back the first time. If you requested all that information for proof of residency, they why didn't you do the same to the person on the other end of the phone. Its very unprofessional and nobody suffers but Tracy P. Your company say that your call are recorded and monitored then you should've went back and checked the incoming calls, very unprofessional, and I will never ever deal with this company ever again first time shame on you second time shame on me. When I asked to speak to someone in the fraud division I was told no that they wasn't able to transfer me. But they allowed someone to transfer $1500 into their account without an interrogation.",

You extend a helping hand and then you do not follow through. I have now lost all confidence in Netspend and feel like you do not care about helping your clients. I have called mutilple times and left numerous messages and it is completely silent on your end. I am going to to assume now that Netspend only cares about taking your money and pretending to want to help. What was the point of reaching out if you were not going to follow through. I want a call back immediately or and email response asap. this is literally the worst customer service and a i was hoping it was only from the call center but it is obvious this lack of concern goes all the way to the top of corporate and it is sad. If this is not resolved soon I will be taking this issue as far as I can so that everyone knows that Netspend are theives and to make sure no one ever goes through this again. This is embarrassing for your company and people need to know. If i do not get a response soon i will be forced to reach out to the BBB, my district attorney, my personal lawyer and the local news to report on how your company did not close a card reported stolen and over $900 in charge being taken from my account. and then how a corporate higher up reached out only because of a review I had and then offered to help and then basically ghosted me. I will make sure that it is known that Lea Campos offered to assist me but lied and never truly meant to help me at all . I will let them know I left you multiple emails and multiple voicemail messages and that you NEVR responded back. You offered your direct line and email address and then NEVER INTENDED TO ACTUALLY HELP ME ! but just pretended to offer help when she truly had no intentions of ever following through with her offer to assist. $900 was taken from my account and no one seems to care. Id like to also point out that I was blocked on their facebook page when trying to get assistance",

                "commentaire": "Good mornin. I'm experiencing Netspend trouble again folks. I called yesterday noon and the customer representative was trying to tell me to activate my 10th Netspend Card they've sent. I admittedly had responded to a NO! Because many times I've been charge for every card I received and every month ive paid. I'm on I pay monthly outta of my SSI check every month. So that had been including $5.00 a month plus the activation card as well. U know none of the representatives has ever told that I didn't have to activate every time a card was being sent almost every month. I was fed up to here with them dang cards that I was being charge and token advantage by the customer rep. I've only lost one card that I got replace and yes paid for the activation charge then a coupl3 of months later someone stoled my card outta of my wallet at the grocery store. Yes I report it stolen and stop it. So yes they sent me another card that I had to pay for activation fee. Okay 2 cards were fine to pay, after a month every time I would speak to a Netspend Customer representative they would send me another card sometimes 3 times in a month. I was a dummy activating evey card I received one card would do for all the other cards was getting in the mail because it seem like every representative I would talk to they would send a darn card.I got fed up one day and ask nicely why am I receiving all these cards and all these charges I can't prove because it's in my other Galaxy phone thats broke.i can get printed copies of how many times I payed for these cards but at the same time I switch with all netspend access\nthinking it was going to be better but my SSI PAYMENTS ARE LATE. WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation. I feel from my rare disease or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangual\n\n\n\n\n\nIn damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL. IM STILL TRYING TO MANAGE ON TEXTING with no fingers on the phone.NETSPEND CORPTIAON I DONT GET NO GOV ASSITANCR OR EVEN IF I DIS THATS NONE OF NEtSPEND CORPTION CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. WITH THISAPPRECIATE IF SOMEONE,TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS AND GET MY C$$ARD situated with one car one monthly pameny every 25th nd a littl respect on me being disabled ampute on legs and fingers get and give the thw benefit and the doubt to read snd recivied government SSI check on same card on every 25th of the month and stop over charging my card and stop ovwr sendi h me cards nomore. Also i dont why they dont overdraft my cardover more than a $100 thats the most.why??? Why send me proof of saying netdp3nd lets u overdraft over $500.00 as long as $200.00 or $500.00 is being put in The latest was the 25th days in a month. Im asking as a diabled person if they can keep my SSI CHECK on 25th every month. I know that i hope a customer rep csn understand",

Mark sent me a message after I applied for my refinance that he already had me matched with a few lenders. I mixed up 2 numbers on my application as I have slight dyslexia, he then tells me that everyone has denied my application…after he told me he already had me matched and he was putting numbers together. I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they’ll get back but the end of the month is busy for “new applications only” so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application…fine no big deal. It has now been a month. I feel like I’ve been pretty patient and I saw good reviews about the company before I had applied. However, this is just my experience. Take it as you will.",

One of their online marketers called my phone to advertise this useless app to me, firstly I refused that I needed not to borrow, he finally convinced me. After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable. To worsen the case, a week later their online customer started sending messages, death threats, posting negative things about me. I had to call the WhatsApp number that sent me messages and this foolish girl had the nerves to start laying curses on me and my family because of a token I never bargained for. Please guys, to avoid the type of experience and embarrassment I got from these app, please I advise you avoid this app. They are thieves in disguise.",

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location. I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

It was a complete failure to comprehend a very straightforward question. Then she hung up on me and falsely reported in her notes that the call disconnected likely as a move to cover herself for poor customer service. Every phone agent I talked with has been horrendous in customer service. This bank has spiraled downhill so much I am the only one in my family that still has an account. Everyone has jumped ship - my mom, brother, ex-husband, daughters, friends etc. As soon as I severe all direct deposit and debit lines, I am dropping this bank as well.",

Every time we call, we’d talk to someone new and whatever the last person asked for, the new person would ask for again and then ask for something altogether new. We did that for 2 weeks feeling like we were getting the runaround until one day the title company called and was told we couldn’t talk to them any longer because it was in foreclosure. The title company checked and nothing had been filed with the district court. Over the next couple of weeks the executor (only one allowed to talk to them now) has sent reinstatement paperwork and a cashier’s check per the attorney’s instructions only to be told by someone else in the attorney’s office, “Why did you do that? It’s not in foreclosure yet.” We have yet to receive a simple payoff and closing has been delayed 4 weeks to date. We are now in danger of losing the buyer or, at best, the loan costing the buyer more because of PNC’s lack of concern, customer service and reasonable business practices.

What is the specific circumstance?\nImagine if you will a debit card especially designed for direct deposit for government checks like social security. And that very same said organization transferring funds to PNC and in the same 24 hours retracting them. I wrestled with Comerica long enough to realize They will NOT budge. I did everything I could do instructionally to gain access to my PNC account and all the documents they needed to perform a transfer. 3-4 times I tried 3-4 times the money came back. I contacted PNC by phone , my biggest nightmare, and got from a very squeeky voice, \"You might try contacting your other bank (Comerica), so I gave up as I do with all customer service calls with a human. They may even come in email communication, but like I told AMS, I'm better off with fate, and seeing things work out by themselves. Thats all we have. I never complain to myself about my own strategizing and problem solving capabilities.\nDont bother calling PNC customer service unless you like getting no help, no service and a sarcastic know nothing person on the line, worse than Walmart.",

The wait times are always significantly longer than at other PNC locations, and it’s clear that the branch has either understaffing issues or inefficiencies that need attention.\n\nWhat made my recent visit even more disappointing was the unprofessional behavior of one of the staff members, Bria Cooser. Not only was she rude, but she also lacked basic courtesy when interacting with me. I felt that my concerns were dismissed, and I was treated with little respect. As someone who values good customer service, this type of experience is unacceptable.\n\nWhile I understand that branches can get busy, there is no excuse for poor customer service and unprofessional conduct. I hope the management takes these concerns seriously and works on improving both the efficiency of service and the professionalism of their staff. Until then, I will be looking for alternative locations for my banking needs.\n\nAltaf Minhas",
