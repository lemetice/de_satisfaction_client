Evergreen Credit Union,coRpSE,US,"I have had great experience with them, but, I do have one large gripe, and that is the lack of atm locations in the Windham, Gorham, Westbrook area. There is 1 available atm and that is at the bank in North Windham. It would be nice to see some free ATMs be brought to Westbrook / Gorham area so you don't have to drive 20 - 30 min just to use a free ATM.","October 15, 2024"

Evergreen Credit Union,Marian Giovannini,US,"I was very disappointed to be denied a credit card from Evergreen. We successfully paid our boat loan with them and were looking for a good credit card to transfer a higher interest one.
We are homeowners with no mortgage who have been with Evergreen for 5 years. Maybe it's because we are retired?","July 18, 2024"
Evergreen Credit Union,Ted Coffin,US,"My wife and I are buying are house and something appeared on my credit report which was no longer my affiliation. Rebecca was very helpful and fast in getting a letter out to me to clear things up.

Evergreen Credit Union,Ken,SE,"I called the Evergreen's Portland location on Saturday, 04.20.2024. It seemed a log in change had been made which asked if I were an adult. The posting was done by Cloudflare.
The potential for a possible scam or worse gave me pause before answering. The 'authentication' (I guess) somehow gave sufficient proof so I was then able to log into my account.
I also had a rather minor request to edit the names on specific accounts.
My call was taken by Danielle and together we were able to address and resolve.
Having employees who feel professional yet personable service are critical in securing confidence in both Evergreen and their employees.
Your mission and mine were met by Danielle.","April 20, 2024"

Evergreen Credit Union,Lindsay Edwards,US,"Casey has been amazing to work with. I have been waiting for a vehicle to arrive for months and through the entire process, Casey has been informative, responsive and friendly. I am a first time customer and I am so impressed. When I told the finance department at the dealership our rate, they said they wouldn’t even try to match it because they couldn’t get close. My husband is a veteran and we really appreciate the rate discount. It’s an incredible thing to do. Thank you for being the bright side of buying a car.","May 23, 2024"
Evergreen Credit Union,John and Rose Duran,US,"We found Judy Brochu to be sincerely warm and friendly. Anyone can read a script but Judy was obviously doing more than that.

Evergreen Credit Union,Noel Sherburne,US,"I requested bank statements and the request was fulfilled within 15 minutes. Great customer service!

Crypto Dispensers,Cody,US,"I have to say, whenever I am able to exchange words with the team at CryptoDispensers, they exemplify what it means to show world class service WITHOUT FAIL. They offer a great product with an amazing bonus and it pays out as promised, instantly once the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain. That being said I used to have an issue showing up to work at time or at all and my boss told me ""Cody, when you're here, you're amazing, but you're never here!"" It feels like only on a harvest moon the third Tuesday of winter solstice is when you can exchange a few emails from one of the (again world class, outstanding) team members and the stars have aligned and things are as they should be. But until then, their chatbot leaves much to be desired. Clearly I have too much time on my hands haha, I'm wanting to refer them to everyone and their mother and so far I have 5 referrals, 2 that have deposited successfully and 3 that haven't. I've gotten referral credit for one thus far and its my understanding they were still in the process of rolling out the program ( as generous as the sign up bonus itself there are only winners here!) I have faith that it'll work out, and actually Im changing to 5 stars in good faith because idk whats going on behind the scenes but every interaction has been great so thank you thank you.","October 28, 2024"
Crypto Dispensers,customer,US,"Crypto dispensers is a fast and easy way to purchase crypto. I love the changes they’ve made and the referral bonus is a great incentive. I will continue to refer friends to this platform!

Update:

Since leaving a positive review Crypto Dispensers has ignored my recent support tickets. They advertised bonus for my deposit but didn’t follow through. The bonus was supposed to be credited immediately but nothing was added to my account. Upon reaching out, no one has responded in over 5 days. Now I regret making a large deposit and paying the unnecessary fees. It seems like their customer service has returned back to their old unresponsive ways!","July 31, 2024"

The Payment HQ,Jay Dankha,US,"Since day 1 Cesario has been our local rep and has been there every step of the way to help me whenever I needed. The Payment HQ is the best merchant services and most trustworthy company I have dealt with. They support my industry which is considered high risk and made it very easy to get me an account approved. Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what’s best for your business. I absolutely enjoy working with The Payment HQ and of course their best rep Cesario.
Thank you Cesario & The Payment HQ for supporting my business.

In the age when people pretend to be other people, Meriwest provides me ample security, safety, and peace of mind in knowing they can’t be defrauded putting my money in safe hands.","December 13, 2023"
Meriwest Credit Union,Randall Hulsey,US,"I was an almost 30 year client of Meriwest until they upgraded their login system with minimal notification and locked my out of my account. After multiple attempts, I final sent a registered letter to close my account back in March, and have yet to get my money back (now May). They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.

Bottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.","May 20, 2023"

I've had my netspend card for years and a hacker came along about a week ago they first changed all of my personal information, then they were able to call the company and cancel my card, and all of my security questions, Then I received a text afterwards telling me that my aceelite netspend card had been cancelled. So I was drilled and had to send my ID, social security card, and a PGE bill to show proof of address after the fact. Then a couple days ago the person that had all my information was able to transfer my paycheck that was deposited to my card to their account and now they have started an investigation, but unfortunately I'm the victim, I'm wondering why didn't they interrogate the person that committed the crime just like I was interrogated to try and get my money back the first time. If you requested all that information for proof of residency, they why didn't you do the same to the person on the other end of the phone. Its very unprofessional and nobody suffers but Tracy P. Your company say that your call are recorded and monitored then you should've went back and checked the incoming calls, very unprofessional, and I will never ever deal with this company ever again first time shame on you second time shame on me.

Netspend Corporation,Danielle Livingston,US,"Good morning Lea Campos, I am reaching out agin because I would like to speak with you regarding this issue with my account, I have been trying to reach you and or get a response since your initial outreach and again have received no call or correspondence from you at all and it is extremely frustrating. You extend a helping hand and then you do not follow through. I have now lost all confidence in Netspend and feel like you do not care about helping your clients. I have called mutilple times and left numerous messages and it is completely silent on your end. I am going to to assume now that Netspend only cares about taking your money and pretending to want to help. What was the point of reaching out if you were not going to follow through. I want a call back immediately or and email response asap. this is literally the worst customer service and a i was hoping it was only from the call center but it is obvious this lack of concern goes all the way to the top of corporate and it is sad. If this is not resolved soon I will be taking this issue as far as I can so that everyone knows that Netspend are theives and to make sure no one ever goes through this again. This is embarrassing for your company and people need to know. If i do not get a response soon i will be forced to reach out to the BBB, my district attorney, my personal lawyer and the local news to report on how your company did not close a card reported stolen and over $900 in charge being taken from my account. and then how a corporate higher up reached out only because of a review I had and then offered to help and then basically ghosted me. I will make sure that it is known that Lea Campos offered to assist me but lied and never truly meant to help me at all . I will let them know I left you multiple emails and multiple voicemail messages and that you NEVR responded back. You offered your direct line and email address and then NEVER INTENDED TO ACTUALLY HELP ME ! but just pretended to offer help when she truly had no intentions of ever following through with her offer to assist. $900 was taken from my account and no one seems to care.

Netspend Corporation,Vera Menchaca,US,"Good mornin. I'm experiencing Netspend trouble again folks. I called yesterday noon and the customer representative was trying to tell me to activate my 10th Netspend Card they've sent. I admittedly had responded to a NO! Because many times I've been charge for every card I received and every month ive paid. I'm on I pay monthly outta of my SSI check every month. So that had been including $5.00 a month plus the activation card as well. U know none of the representatives has ever told that I didn't have to activate every time a card was being sent almost every month. I was fed up to here with them dang cards that I was being charge and token advantage by the customer rep. I've only lost one card that I got replace and yes paid for the activation charge then a coupl3 of months later someone stoled my card outta of my wallet at the grocery store. Yes I report it stolen and stop it. So yes they sent me another card that I had to pay for activation fee. Okay 2 cards were fine to pay, after a month every time I would speak to a Netspend Customer representative they would send me another card sometimes 3 times in a month. I was a dummy activating evey card I received one card would do for all the other cards was getting in the mail because it seem like every representative I would talk to they would send a darn card.I got fed up one day and ask nicely why am I receiving all these cards and all these charges I can't prove because it's in my other Galaxy phone thats broke.i can get printed copies of how many times I payed for these cards but at the same time I switch with all netspend access
thinking it was going to be better but my SSI PAYMENTS ARE LATE. WHY? EVERY MONTH I WOULD recieve every of the 25th od the month.I could overdraft my card as long as more than $500.00 dollars a month go in my netspend card which does to cover m6 overdraft. I borrowed but put back every 25th days before even 30 days more like every 24 days in a month. before then it was changing to the 25 th I'm not activating the new one they sent me because I lost my last one over a extra smount of charges from prime video and lifetime and other expensive app. Without my knowledge and without my approval. So I'm keeping the last card. Me I'm done on all these extra cards being ordered I'm tired of being token advantage because I'm disabled and a amputee on both legs below the knee I'm being taken advantage because I have no fingers to text or call the netspend corporation. I feel from my rare disease or I'm not compressing what their saying or the other lady ask me to speak right but i lost al my teeth. Lady my color skin has nothing to do what we are talking about. If I'm mix with black and Hispanic and puterorican and Mexican that's who I and those are all my languages I'm gonna speak. I'm too black gurl talk or I'm too Mexican speaking shouldn't be spoken to someone who is biolangual





In damn overall I'm tired of being abused by people who can't or won't understand all types of my different languages, but that doesn't have nothing to do with my payments in on the 25th of every month like I used received my SSI payments are important on the 25th of every month that's when my bills are due because of how I set it up every month of the 25 th . Look I'm disabled amputee on both legs knee below and all of my fingers are smputaed as well, BUT,,,,BUT, STILL DIsABLED AND ALL. IM STILL TRYING TO MANAGE ON TEXTING with no fingers on the phone.NETSPEND CORPTIAON I DONT GET NO GOV ASSITANCR OR EVEN IF I DIS THATS NONE OF NEtSPEND CORPTION CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE. WITH THISAPPRECIATE IF SOMEONE,TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS AND GET MY C$$ARD situated with one car one monthly pameny every 25th nd a littl respect on me being disabled ampute on legs and fingers get and give the thw benefit and the doubt to read snd recivied government SSI check on same card on every 25th of the month and stop over charging my card and stop ovwr sendi h me cards nomore. Also i dont why they dont overdraft my cardover more than a $100 thats the most.why??? Why send me proof of saying netdp3nd lets u overdraft over $500.00 as long as $200.00 or $500.00 is being put in The latest was the 25th days in a month. Im asking as a diabled person if they can keep my SSI CHECK on 25th every month. I know that i hope a customer rep csn understand","September 25, 2023"

I mixed up 2 numbers on my application as I have slight dyslexia, he then tells me that everyone has denied my application…after he told me he already had me matched and he was putting numbers together. I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they’ll get back but the end of the month is busy for “new applications only” so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application…fine no big deal.

After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable.

I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty.

Centrohelp,Brittany,US,"THIS IS A SCAM. I lost only $200 thankfully, still guts me but not the 2k I’m seeing others unfortunately lost. I received a fraud notification from my bank and I remembered falling prey to a fraudulent text about my USPS incoming mail notifications. I’m used to getting them bc if I have a package on the way they tell me. I was dumb and I’m even normally vigilant about this. CANCEL YOUR DEBIT CARD IMMEDIATELY and tell your bank it was fraudulent activity. Be vigilant, folks!","September 17, 2022"
Centrohelp,Michael C,US,"Same as most everyone else here. I have made extra sure to deselect the box at checkout for the $34.95 ""free trial"" but they eventually added it anyway. Could get no response from the game site about it, and no response from Centrobill. I've been trying for 3 months to get this cleared up but they just keep charging me. My ""subscription"" gave me nothing and was inaccessible on the actual game site. Had to log into Centrohelp with their shady link to remove my payment info. Next is asking the bank to reverse the charges.","February 21, 2023"

Centrohelp,Charisse Anna Streeter-Wenger,US,They stole over $2000 from my son's account. The bank is telling him they can't do anything since it's a digital transaction/company. These people are crooks and should be put in jail for scamming money. Stealing from someone who doesn't have much to line their pockets to get rich is unbelievably wrong.

Centrohelp,Roman V,ES,"Please be aware that this company is alleged of helping to process FRAUDULENT CARD PAYMENTS via #Paymentico.com #Segpay #Stripchat payment processors.

It has happened to me last month and third party scammed me and used my card data simply, as it looks like , to drain my bank account by charging more than 30 times for maximum charge. These companies simply paid my stolen cash to someone and now not only refused to refund facilitated Fraud , but refused to produce documents to whom they paid money.

I understand and allegations are that they simply HELP FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS TO BE CASHED OUT

MY ADVISE IS - STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

If you NOTICE CHARGES WITH REFERENCES #Paymentico.com or #Techchathelp #Stripchat #CentroHelp

REPORT THEM ASAP TO YOUR BANK AND REQUEST TO CHARGEBACK THEM!

DO NOT BE EMBARRASSED THAT THEY WILL CLAIM YOU PAID FOR ADULT STUFF, as to my opinion, THIS IS PART OF THEIR TACTICS TO AVOID REFUNDS.

be prepared that they will claim that you are the biggest scammer in the world :) simply it highlights possible bullying tactics adopted to intimidate people who has principles and wants to get their hard earned cash back from entities who drained their accounts.

It also seams that there is only ONE man in charge in all these companies, who is juggling all fraudulent transactions and handling all refund requests - GEORGE

HE HAS OFFERED TO ME DIRECT CASH PAYMENT (not even half or requested refunds) - IF I AGREE NOT TO ESCALATE THIS AND NOT COMPLAIN TO THE POLICE



MORE WE COMPLAIN QUICKER VISA AND MASTERCARD WILL TAKE ACTION AND SIMPLY CUT THEM OUT FROM PAYMENT SYSTEM. If you had issue with any of these companies - do inform your bank regarding:
