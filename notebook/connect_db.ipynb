I was listed jointly on his checking account, but it is unclear whether I was actually listed on his other accounts, or his safe deposit box, which he had given me a key for. After he passed, they would not allow me to cancel his safe deposit box and renewed the rent for another year by drafting funds from his account. Of all the accounts he had in various places the accounts at this bank have been by far the most difficult to close out and obtain our funds. Every time I provide something they ask for something else no other financial institution requested. Their \"policies\" appear to be designed just to keep the funds as long as possible. After doing a review on the BBB website they conatcted me. However, after playing phone tag with them for several days all they did was waste even more of time again citing their policy. They did volunteer that they would honor a court order to release the funds - LOL - how nice of them.', 'nombre_reviews': '1 review', 'date_experience': 'October 15, 2024', 'reply': None}\n",

Mark sent me a message after I applied for my refinance that he already had me matched with a few lenders. I mixed up 2 numbers on my application as I have slight dyslexia, he then tells me that everyone has denied my application…after he told me he already had me matched and he was putting numbers together. I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they’ll get back but the end of the month is busy for “new applications only” so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application…fine no big deal. It has now been a month. I feel like I’ve been pretty patient and I saw good reviews about the company before I had applied. However, this is just my experience.

After he passed, they would not allow me to cancel his safe deposit box and renewed the rent for another year by drafting funds from his account. Of all the accounts he had in various places the accounts at this bank have been by far the most difficult to close out and obtain our funds. Every time I provide something they ask for something else no other financial institution requested. Their \"policies\" appear to be designed just to keep the funds as long as possible. After doing a review on the BBB website they conatcted me. However, after playing phone tag with them for several days all they did was waste even more of time again citing their policy.
